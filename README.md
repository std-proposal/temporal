# TC39 Temporal Proposal Polyfill

This is an implementation of a polyfill for the [TC39 Temporal Proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal).

**This is a moving implementation. It is currently changing along with the proposal. Sometimes
it will implement suggestions to try out that have not yet been agreed. Use with caution!!!**

# Temporal

Temporal is the proposal of a new date & time handling API for ECMA-Script. The design principles are:

- All temporal APIs are non-mutating.  All temporal objects are effectively immutable.
- All date values are based on the [Proleptic Gregorian Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleptic_Gregorian_calendar).  Other calendar systems are out-of-scope for this proposal.  However, we will consider how future APIs may interact with this one such that extending it to support other calendars may be possible in a future proposal.
- All time-of-day values are based on a standard 24-hour clock.
- [Leap seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second) are not represented.

## Timeline Objects

There is a subset of temporal objects that are tied to the absolute timeline meaning they are relative to a specific and specified point in time. In this case that time is the [POSIX-epoch](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap03.html#tag_03_150) and follows the rules established in [ECMA-262](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-time-values-and-time-range). They represent a specific point in time.

These are `Instant`, `OffsetDateTime`, and `ZonedDateTime` in order of amount of detail information available in them.

`Instant` just represents an absolute point in time. No timezone or offset information is present. As such Instants have no concept of days or months or even hours.

`OffsetDateTime` is the combination of an Instant with an offset from UTC. As such it has the ability to know about days, months, etc. However it does not know what timezone or locality it is in. As such it cannot know which daylight saving rules apply.

`ZonedDateTime` represents an `OffsetDateTime` combined with an *IANA Timezone*. With that added information ZonedDateTime is able to observe daylight saving rules.

**All temporal object are immutable in that their properties are getters only.**

### Instant <a name="Instant" />
An `Instant` is an object that specifies a specific point in time. For convenience of interoperability it uses *nanoseconds since the unix-epoch* to do so.
#### Instant() - constuctor

#### Instant.prototype.epochSeconds : number

The `epochSeconds` property of an `Instant` object represents the *seconds since POSIX-epoch*.

#### Instant.prototype.epochMilliseconds: number

The `epochMilliseconds` property of an `Instant` object represents the *whole milliseconds since POSIX-epoch*.

This is equivalent to `new ZonedDateTime(instant, zone)`

#### Instant.prototype.withOffset(offset: string) : [OffsetDateTime](#OffsetDateTime)

This creates a `OffsetDateTime` by applying an *offset-string* to the instant.

This is equivalent to `new OffsetDateTime(instant, offset)`

#### Instant.fromString(iso: string) : [Instant](#Instant)

Equivalent to `new Instant(epochnanos)`.

#### Instant.fromEpochMicroseconds(epochmicros: BigInt) : [Instant](#Instant)

An `OffsetDateTime` is an object that specifies a specific point in time with a specific offset from *UTC*.
It bases this on an `Instant` and an offset `string`.

#### OffsetDateTime(instant: Instant, offset: string) - constructor

The constructor may only be called as such. It takes two arguments. The first is an instance
of `Instant` and the second is a `string` representing a valid time offset.

#### OffsetDateTime.prototype.instant : BigInt

The instance of `Instant` that is being referenced by this `OffsetDateTime`.

#### OffsetDateTime.prototype.offset : string

- `sign` is either `+` or `-`
- `hours` is the hours offset 0-padded to 2 digits.
- `minutes` is the minutes offset 0-padded to 2 digits.

Examples: `+00:00`, `-04:00`, `+03:00`, ...

#### OffsetDateTime.prototype.year: number

The `.year` property represents the year of the `OffsetDateTime` according to the proleptic Gregorian calendar with a midnight to midnight 24 hour day.

#### ZonedDateTime.isValidTimezone(iana: string) : boolean

A method that can be used to check if a give string is a valid IANA-Timezone representation.

## Unbound Objects

Unbound objects are objects that do not represent a date or time tied to the actual concrete timeline. Imagine a note saying "be home by 14:45". That information is not tied to a specific point in time. You don't know where the note came from. It could have been written at any time in the past. No date attaches to it. Equally you can't tell what timezone it belongs in. It may not mean local time.

Even information like "I was born on the 18th of November 1976 at 15:23:30" does not attach to a specific point in time. We still lack the location of where the speaker was born.

In addition there are more abstract dates that are used frequently in civil discourse. Such as "Christmas is on the 25th of December". Which year? Or "I moved to Britain in August 2014". Which day in August?

These objects all have in common is that they are not tied to a specific point on the timeline.

**Again all temporal object are immutable in that their properties are getters only.**

Is the **integer** number of seconds difference this interval represents.

#### Duration.prototype.milliseconds: number

Is the **integer** number of milliseconds difference this interval represents.

#### Duration.prototype.microseconds: number

Is the **integer** number of microseconds difference this interval represents.

#### Duration.prototype.nanoseconds: number

Is the **integer** number of nanoseconds difference this interval represents.

### Operations

#### Difference

The difference operation implimented via the `minus` method on temporal objects allow taking the difference between like objects, resulting in an `Duration`. The specificity of the interval will depend on the objects involved.

Example:
 * CivilDate - will produce an Duration with potential *non-zero* values in `years`, `months` and `days` with all other fields nulled out.
 * CivilTime - will prodce an Duration with potential *non-zero* values in `hours`, `minutes`,  `seconds`, `milliseconds`, `microseconds` and `nanoeconds` with all other fields nulled out.
 * `CivilDateTime` - will produce an Duration where all fields are potentially *non-zero*

#### Addition

The addition operation is implemented via the `plus` method on temporal objects. These methods take an DurationLike as an argument that is first converted to an actual Duration. That means that *non-integer* value in interval fields will be floored.

Adding an interval to a type means taking only the corresponding interval values and ignoring all others.

Example: CivilDate plus { hours: 48 } is a no-op since hours does not have a corresponding member to hours and they are therefore ignored.

## Interfaces

Interfaces are not actually defined, they are simply conveniences to make conversing about temporal objects, methods and their arguments easier.

### DateLike <a name="DateLike" />

Any JS object that has date like properties. These are:

* year - a numeric representing the gregorian year
* month - a numeric representing the gregorian month
* day - a numeric representing the gregorian day

These properties are all optional, but if they are on a DateLike object they have to be numeric.

### TimeLike <a name="TimeLike" />

Any JS object that has time like properties. These are:

- hour - a numeric representing the hour of the day
- minute - a numeric representing the minute of the hour
- second - a numeric representing the second of the minute
- millisecond - a numeric representing the millisecond of the second
- microsecond - a numeric representing the microsecond of the second
- nanosecond - a numeric representing the nanoseconds of the microsecond

These properties are all optional, but if they are on a TimeLike object they have to be numeric.

### DateTimeLike <a name="DateTimeLike" />

Any JS object that is both a DateLike and a TimeLike.

### DurationLike <a name="DurationLike" />

Any JS object that has interval properties. These are:

* years - number of years difference
* months - number of months difference
* days -  number of day difference
* hours - number of hours difference
* minutes - number of minutes difference
* seconds - number of seconds difference
* milliseconds - number of milliseconds difference
* microseconds - number of microseconds difference
* nanoseconds - number of nanoseconds difference

These properties are all optional, but if they are on an DurationLike object they have to be numeric.
